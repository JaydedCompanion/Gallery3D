# Gallery3D - A Procedurally Generated 3D Gallery

Generate a 3D gallery/museum-like environment from a folder full of images. Powered by Unity.

## How To Use

After the application is launched for the first time, a folder called "GalleryImages" will appear. Simply place image files inside and they will be used when the application is launched.

## Deployment

Final version can simply be compiled by Unity (Or simply snag a build from the Releases section). Currently tested to work on MacOS and Windows. Should work on most other desktop platforms. Older versions work on WebGL builds but with pre-defined images.

## Progress

Current features
* Layout is generated randomly at runtime, allowing for any number of images to be shown
* On-screen controls allows mouse-only navigation
* Reading images from external storage
* Create post-processing stack

Planned features
* Generate level in such way no extra canvas slots are left over
* Background music support
