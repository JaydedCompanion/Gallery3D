# Gallery3D - A Procedurally Generated 3D Gallery

Generate a 3D gallery/museum-like environment from a folder full of images. Powered by Unity.

## How To Use

~User-picked images are not yet supported~

## Deployment

Current build settings are optimized for WebGL builds, though the on-screen controls make the project fully functional on mouse/touch only platforms. No libraries/plugins have been used that might cause build errors when building to platforms other than WebGL, though the have not been tested. 

Final version will likely be aimed towards desktop platforms so that the user may choose the images to display in the gallery.

## Progress

Current features
* Layout is generated randomly at runtime, allowing for any number of images to be shown
* On-screen controls allows mouse-only navigation

Planned features
* Reading images from external storage at runtime
* Generate level in such way no extra canvas slots are left over
* Create post-processing stack
* Background music support
